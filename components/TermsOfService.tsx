          Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the Langcampus Exchange application (the "Service") operated by Langcampus ("us", "we", or "our"). Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.
        </p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">1. Accounts</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To use our Service, you must create an account using Google's authentication service. You are responsible for safeguarding your account and for any activities or actions under your account. You agree not to disclose your password to any third party.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">2. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Service offers a free tier with daily usage limits and a paid subscription plan ("Langcampus Pro") for unlimited access.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Billing:</strong> Subscriptions are billed on a recurring basis (e.g., monthly or yearly). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle").
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment Processor:</strong> All payments are processed through our third-party payment processor, Stripe. By providing payment information, you agree that we may authorize Stripe to charge your payment method for your chosen subscription plan. We do not store your payment card details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Price Changes:</strong> Langcampus, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the subscription fees. Any subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription before such change becomes effective.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">3. Subscription Management and Cancellation</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You are solely responsible for managing your subscription. You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through the Stripe customer billing portal. A link to the portal can be accessed from the "My Info" section within the application.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will take effect at the end of your current Billing Cycle. You will not be charged for the next cycle. You will continue to have access to the Pro features of the Service until the end of your current paid period.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">4. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p className="font-bold mb-4">
          All payments are non-refundable. Langcampus does not offer refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods or unused services. Once a payment is made, it is final.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">5. Termination</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We may terminate or suspend your account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">6. Contact Us</h2>
